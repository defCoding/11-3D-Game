# 11-3D-Game
I created a simple game where the objective is to run away from pursuers through a city, and the goal is to last as long as possible. "Running" is emulated by having the spawned buildings move toward the player, rather than have the player move toward the building. This allows us to stay on a rather small piece of land, and use it as a "treadmill". Sound effects were added to simulate running and jumping. I initially intended to add a camera bob to really sell the running bit, but I was unable to figure out how to get that to work.
